This is THE MOST DELICIOUS CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER!!! Since i have also tried this recipe i can tell you that its Moist,Fluffy and Yummy.


Ingredients

 butter and flour for coating and dusting the cake pan
 3 cups all-purpose flour
 3 cups granulated sugar
 1½ cups unsweetened cocoa powder
 1 tablespoon baking soda
 1½ teaspoons baking powder
 1½ teaspoons salt
 4 large eggs
 1½ cups buttermilk
 1½ cups warm water
 ½ cup vegetable oil
 2 teaspoons vanilla extract


Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter three 9-inch cake rounds. Dust with flour and tap out the excess.

 Mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand mixer using a low speed until combined.

 Add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on a medium speed until smooth. This should take just a couple of minutes.

 Divide batter among the three pans. I found that it took just over 3 cups of the batter to divide it evenly.

Bake for 30-35 minutes until the cake meets the toothpick test (stick a toothpick in and it comes out clean).

 Cool on wire racks for 15 minutes and then turn out the cakes onto the racks and allow to cool completely.

7️ Frost with your favorite frosting and enjoy!
